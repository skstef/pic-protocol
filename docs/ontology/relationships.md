# Relationships

This page describes how ontology concepts relate to one another.

## Ownership

An **Actor** may own one or more **Resources**.

Example:

- A user owns a document

## Association

Entities may reference other entities without ownership.

Example:

- A comment references a document

## Constraints

- Relationships should be explicitly defined
- Circular relationships should be avoided unless required
