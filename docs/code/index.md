# Libraries and Code

This section collects libraries, projects, and demos related to PIC.

PIC is defined solely by its **formal model** and **generic specification**.
Code listed here does not define PIC and does not replace the specification.

The section is intentionally divided into:

- **Libraries** — reusable code intended to support PIC-based systems
- **Projects & Demos** — external efforts that claim PIC alignment

## Libraries

Libraries provide reusable building blocks for experimenting with
or implementing PIC concepts.

| Language | Project   | Description                                               | Repository                                      |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Rust     | pic-rust  | Experimental Rust library for PIC concepts and structures | https://github.com/pic-protocol/pic-rust        |

Libraries may be incomplete, experimental, or evolving.

## Projects & Demos (External Claims)

This section lists **external projects and demos** that **publicly claim**
to implement, demonstrate, or be inspired by the PIC model.

PIC **does not sponsor, certify, test, audit, or verify**
any of the entries listed below.

Projects and demos appear here **solely based on their own claims**.
Their presence does **not** imply:

- correctness
- security
- completeness
- conformance to the PIC Specification

PIC performs **no validation or conformance testing**. Responsibility for correctness and alignment rests entirely with the project maintainers.

If a project or demo is found to:

- misrepresent the PIC model
- violate core PIC invariants
- make misleading or incorrect claims about PIC

it **may be removed** from this list.

PIC remains defined exclusively by its formal model and specification, not by third-party code.
